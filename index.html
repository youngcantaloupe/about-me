                <h2>My interests:</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy playing Minecraft. It's a game I've played for around 12 years now, and I still not tired of it. Although it is just a video game, it's been a great creative outlet and helped shape the way I view the world.</p>
                    <p> In a related note, I also enjoy Rocket League. I played for my previous institutions esports team in 2024 spring. Our team did pretty well that season, placing 3rd in a tier 2 NJCAA tournament.</p>
                    <p>In the past year, I've gotten back into hiking. It has been a great way to touch grass and connect with nature. I'm quite excited for this summer, I have a few big hikes/camping trips I am planning with my brothers.</p>
