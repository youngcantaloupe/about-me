                            <p><i>On fire, faith and forging of the blade of wisdom.</i></p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Naïve individuals are unaware of the malevolence present in the world—and in themselves. It is a natural progression for the naïve to become cynical after being bitten by the snake, albeit an improvement—cynicism is but a resting place on the road to wisdom. The challenge, then, is to rediscover optimism through faith without reverting to naïveté. At first glance, it seems impossible to reclaim optimism after cynicism takes hold of your sight as it demands some sort of willful blindness. And yet, the path becomes clear through the substitution of courage for naïveté.</p>
                            <p>What lies beyond cynicism? Wisdom. But wisdom is not naïve—it is courageous. It sees malevolence clearly, yet chooses to act anyway. Faith, in this sense, is not blind belief, but the willingness to proceed as though the path ahead is navigable, even when the outcome is uncertain. It is the presupposition that you can ride the wave, no matter how large it becomes.</p>
                            <p>Most cynics aren't cynical enough toward their own cynicism. They distrust everything—except the lens through which they distrust. But that lens, too, should be questioned. Otherwise, cynicism becomes less a tool of discernment and more a shield against the responsibility of hope. That is not wisdom. It is stagnation.</p>
                            <p>Life is wrought with pain and suffering—no matter the path you choose. My future is likely to be no different. This is the cost of being alive. But if I’m already all in—committed by breath and blood—then I might as well take the adventurous route.</p>
                            <p>Part of that adventure is truth: saying what I think, and letting go of the consequences. Truth is not a fragile concept, but it is elusive—hard to discern, harder to speak. Yet both light and darkness unveil a narrow path in which truth lies. When walking along this path, aim and orientation matter as they govern your perception and the obstacles you encounter. </p>
                            <p>So the question becomes: what attitude should one bring to bear upon the inevitability of suffering? </p>
                            <p>I believe the answer lies in courage—meeting life head-on, not with bitterness, but with faith that you will survive the storm. This is not a belief born of delusion or naïve hope, but a conscious decision: to refuse the burden of cynicism toward the certainties of life.</p>
                            <p>True wisdom lies not in resistance, but in one’s ability to move through suffering—like water shaping itself to the contours of the world. Water yields, but it endures. It flows, but it wears down even stone. To walk the path well is to carry that same strength: flexible, faithful, and quietly unstoppable.</p>
                            <p>But truth is not simply a concept to be admired—it is a force, like fire. It burns away illusion. It exposes what’s hidden. And when you choose to speak it, you risk being scorched. Yet that fire is the very thing that tempers you. Without it, there can be no forging. Without it, there can be no edge—only raw, unshaped metal.</p>
                            <p>To live in truth is to remain in the fire long enough to emerge whole. It is to say what you see, even when your voice trembles. It is to act on what you know, even when it costs you something. And it is to trust that what remains—after the burning—is real.</p>
                            <p>But truth, though absolute, is not always discernable. What we perceive is shaped by where we stand—and where we choose to look. This is the question of orientation. Like the prisoners in Plato’s cave, we may mistake shadows for substance, mistaking the flickering images for the full shape of reality. We see only what the light reveals—and only in the direction we’re willing to face.</p>
                            <p>To escape the cave is to reorient the soul. It is not merely a change in scenery, but a transformation of perception. At first, the light is blinding. The truth appears harsh, even unbearable. But over time, vision adjusts. Clarity comes—not as comfort, but as capacity: the ability to see things as they are, and still choose to walk forward.</p>
                            <p>Cynicism may mark the beginning of wisdom, but it is not its end. People often start out naïve and optimistic, unable to distinguish between fantasy and delusion. But responsibility clarifies. It draws a boundary between what is merely imagined and what must be acted upon. And within that boundary, something surprising is revealed: adventure.</p>
                            <p>There may be no meaningful difference between responsibility and adventure at all. For what could be more daring than to willingly bear a burden, to aim oneself at something worth striving toward? Adventure can be found in the voluntary adoption of responsibility—not in fleeing from it.</p>
                            <p>So the question becomes: what aim, if truly pursued, would make all other meaningful aims more likely to fall into place? What proximal goals serve the greater end? And what ultimate aim lends meaning to the steps along the way? These are not merely strategic concerns. They are existential ones.</p>
                            <p>To live well is to aim well. And to aim well is to walk the path of truth, responsibility, and courage—not as a guarantee of ease, but as an affirmation of meaning.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <div class="textbox">
                            <p>Americans have a rich heritage filled with prominent figures who led the charge toward profound change that rippled across the globe. Truly great change can be marked by the significant problems it aims to solve. America’s first template of government, the Articles of Confederation, was far from perfect, many influential figures came together with the aim to design a framework capable of addressing these problems (Fox and Pope, p. 81). At the forefront of this momentous change was the nationalist James Madison who presented solutions to solve key problems that became foundational elements to what we now call the American government.</p>
                            <p>In a world full of tyrannical leaders and citizens void of a voice, Madison presented a powerful solution to the issues of representation in large populations. Madison, the most ardent of the nationalists, understood key flaws in the Articles of Confederation and proposed a feature of national government that could sustain proportionate representation among citizens in all states (Fox and Pope, p. 87). This feature came to be known as the Virginia Plan offering proportional representation based on the population of a state, Madison argued that this plan was more capable of capturing the voices of citizens (Fox and Pope, p. 87, 88). With many delegates resisting the sacrifice of state power the great compromise came to fruition, creating a structure in which proportional and equal representation would coexist in a bicameral legislature (Fox and Pope, p. 88, 89). Madison’s proposal toward significant reconstruction of national government became a keystone in the balance between state and national power.</p>
                            <p>Madison realized the risk of potential anarchy large factions might cause and constructed a preventative system of checks and balances. Even with a system to prevent tyrannical reign in the government body, a classical republican theory argues a republic can only be managed in small populations (Fox and Pope, p. 94). The founder's awareness of this theory led them to believe an extended republic may allow factions to become powerful enough to oppose the national government (Fox and Pope, p. 95). However, Madison came to question the ideas of the republican theorists, realizing an extended republic would instead create a more stable body politic where factions effectively checked one another through competition (Fox and Pope, p. 95). Madison’s critical thinking formed a new set of checks and balances capable of sustaining the growth America came to experience.</p>
                            <p>Without explicitly listed rights many citizens feared their rights would be left vulnerable to the new powerful central government. The anti-federalist’s strongest opposition to the constitution was the lack of a bill of rights, the federalists countered with a promise to the voters that a bill of rights would be amended (Fox and Pope, p. 102). Many difficulties arise when defining natural rights, as the inclusion of any right would result in the exclusion of others (Fox and Pope, p. 107). Rising to the challenge, Madison fulfilled the federalist’s campaign promise and drafted amendments carefully and concretely to instate rights in language capable of being held up in a court of law (Fox and Pope, p. 107, 108). Madison’s efforts ensured the protection of natural rights and contributed to the fundamental American value of freedom.</p>
                            <p>Americans have inherited core values that are deeply embedded within the foundation of government. The most important member of the primary framers, James Madison realizing the problems of the Confederation, carefully designed a new government (Fox and Pope, p. 87). In this design, Madison presented solutions to problems of government that in turn formed a keystone of values rooted in sovereignty and freedom.</p>

                        <h3>The Nature of Taoism<br><small>14 December 2023</small></h3>
                        <div class="textbox">
                            <p>Today, at our fingertips we have access to technology and information that people even just 100 years ago couldn’t imagine. This technology and information allow us to provide education to more people than ever before. As advanced as we are today, a large portion of what is taught in schools today comes from people from the past, some from history, and some from ancient history. Many young students may think that there is little to learn from ancient people and ideas; However, I believe that ancient concepts can teach us many things even in our day of advanced technology. In the next few paragraphs, I would like to discuss the nature of Daoism. I aim to answer questions like what nature is and what the foundational principles of nature are through the lens of Daoist thought, along with an application to modern-day problems involving nature.  </p>
                            <p>One question that is important to answer is the definition of nature; It could be physically described as the trees that grow or the river that flows. A different definition of nature could be the way things are, or the natural way of things. Daoism describes the way things are in terms of the Dao. This is best described by the first chapter of the Tao Te Ching which reads as follows: “The Dao that can be described is not the enduring and unchanging Dao. The name that can be named is not he enduring and unchanging name. Having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; Having a name it is the mother of all things” (Tzu and Legge, p.3). This is an important concept because the first chapter describes how nature exists in congruence with the Dao, or that nature is the Dao. Paradoxically, it is important to reiterate that describing the Dao is a fruitless effort. Daoism teaches that flow, harmony and balance are things we all should aim to live within. The way we live in balance can be observed through Wu Wei which can be described as effortless non-action, or actions without intention (Brodd, 2022, p. 285). Nature exemplifies Wu Wei perfectly. When we look at trees in a forest it is as if nothing is happening; However, that is not the case. Over time many changes occur that cannot be observed through the course of one moment. The trees bloom in the spring and die in the fall. This cyclical nature continues with no exaggerated effort from the forest, it simply just happens. </p>
                            <p>As a whole, Daoism emphasizes the importance of harmony and its role in the framework of the universe. Another principle which explains this is yang and yin. This is described as “Two polar yet complementary energies known as qi (‘breath’, ‘energy,’ or ‘force’) … One is called yang (literally south-facing, Sunnyside of a mountain) and the other yin (the north-facing, shady side of a mountain). Representing all binary entities and concepts (such as day and night, male and female, hot and cold), yang and yin interact alternate ceaselessly to form a continuum or spectrum, generating the myriad of things in the process” (Brodd, 2022, p. 270). The symbol representing yang and yin is widely recognized across the world. This symbol visually shows the duality of nature; Trees bloom in the spring which would be yang, trees also die in the fall which would be yin. Everything in nature manifests in a perfect balance, this is the framework which governs the cycle of the universe according to Daoist thought. </p>
                            <p>Discussing the principles taught in Daoism and their relatedness to nature is the point of this essay, but it got me thinking how these ideas could be synthesized into more modern-day problems we face today. Climate change is a major topic in classrooms, and debate panels, across the country but what would a Daoist say about it? It is an interesting question to think about because in a way it seems conflicting. A Daoist could compare life to a river, something that has a set path and is essentially something that we are along the ride for. Meaning almost everything is out of our control, we are left to observe where the river takes us. Well, what would a Daoist say about climate change? I believe that an appropriate answer would be: Oh, look at the world and how it is changing. This is an observation and a neutral one at that. I believe that observation is also a key component of Daoism; This being manifested in the form of meditation. The balance of yang and yin is not a fragile concept; In the action of humans trying to control nature, its consequence, in many years, is a climate in which humans will not be able to survive within. Regardless of whether change occurs that allow us to continue living in the current climate, nature will adapt, change, and continue with or without us, as nature has survived much greater cataclysms in ancient history. This could be considered a grim outlook but, from the Daoist perspective we are not the center of the universe, contrary to western thought, we are a small part of a much greater picture that is balanced in accordance with the Dao. </p>
                            <p>With a religion that’s center is nature; Is observation all we are meant to do about climate change? Is there no action we should take? I believe that these questions can be better understood by referring to the principle of Wu Wei - actions without intention. As a society we have become hyper fixated on the results of every action. This is to say that we do things to obtain a certain result. This could be a factor in what has caused the problem in the first place, but it affects the very way we phrase the question. What is the best solution? This fixates on the result and implies that there is a solution. Wu Wei teaches that we must act without attachment to the result that comes after. A Daoist would understand that the average person does not have the power to make great change, like changing entire continents to more sustainable power sources and such. They would probably not tell someone to boycott a certain power source or something if it is out of their means and requires extraordinary effort. But I do believe that a Daoist would tell the individual to go along with the flow, this is to say that if the opportunity to learn how to grow your own food presents itself, they should take it. If it is within your means to take public transportation, switch to a more sustainable power source, or use less plastic, then they should do that too. </p>
                            <p>Daoism explains itself in terms of nature, it uses analogies and metaphors explaining things in terms of nature to explain itself. This is because nature embodies the principles perfectly and that Daoism is an interpretation of nature. An interpretation of the framework of the universe. When looking through the lens of Daoism going with the flow makes the most sense, many problems work themselves out. In order to live in accordance with nature, one must embrace the outcome and begin to let go of the results of the actions one takes. This is exemplified best in the analogy of the river. I hope to have explained the interrelatedness of nature in the religion Daoism, and how we can still learn many things from ideas that are much older than we are. The last two paragraphs could be an incorrect interpretation degraded into subjectivity, but I found it to be a fun thought experiment that made me think deeply about the nature of Daoism and its applications to today’s world. </p>
